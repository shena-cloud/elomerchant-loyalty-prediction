Elo, is one of the largest payments brands in brazil, which wants to predict a loyalty score for each of its customer. Right now Elo has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects and preferences in their customers’ lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile. In this competition, Kagglers will develop algorithms to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty. Your input will improve customers’ lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience for customers.
